#You can get input from users/tell python that you want to get input from the user like this:
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("Hello " + name + "!")
# This will run in your terminal, and when you enter your name and hit enter, it will return "Hello Brevan!"

# You can ask the user to input more than one piece of information:
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = input("Enter your age: ")
# print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age) 
# This will run in terminal, and once you enter both pieces of information, it will return "Hello Brevan! You are 22"
