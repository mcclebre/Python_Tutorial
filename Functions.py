# The first thing you need to do to create a function, is use def, name the function, and then follow it with a colon (:).
# Following the setup of the function, anything written with an indent is considered a part of the function. If it is not indented, it will be considered outside the scope of that function by python.
# def sayHi(): 
#     hello
#     hello
#     hello
# hellothere
# so in this example, the three hellos would be a part of the sayHi() function, but hellothere is not a part of the function.

# def sayHi(): 
#     print("Hello User")

# sayHi()
# You must call the function after creating it, just like you would in JS. The flow of python is top to bottom like JS as well. 

# def say_hi(name):
#     print("Hello " + name )

# say_hi("Brevan")
# say_hi("Stephano")
# Just like JS, you can provide parameters for the function, making it require some more information before running.

#///////////////////Return statements in functions////////////////////
# Return statements work the same way as they would in JS. Notice that print() is going to be like console.log() in JS. In order to visualize your return in the terminal, you must use print()


# def cubed_num(number):
#     return number*number*number
    

# print(cubed_num(5)) 


# def cubed_num(number):
#     return number*number*number
    

# result = cubed_num(10)
# print(result)



# def cubed_num(number):
#     solution = (number*number*number)
#     return solution

# print(cubed_num(3))
