# You can print numbers the same way you would print a string:
# print(2)
# The numbers can be any number (whole, decimals, negative, etc.)

# You can also do basic arithmatic when printing:
# print(4 + 6) #This can also be done with subtraction, division, or multiplication
# This example would add the numbers together and return 10. You can do more complex equations, which would follow the order of operations and return the answer.
#print(4 * (5 / 2)) # This would also return 10.
# You can also use the % sign to divide and return the remainder. Ex:
#print(10 % 3) # This would divide 10 by 3, which would be 3 with a remainder of 1, so the return would equal 1.
# You can also store numbers in variables, and return in the same way as using the number literally.

# You can use the str() function to turn a number into a string, and you can also use your variables to do the same thing. Ex:
# my_num = 7
# print(str(my_num)) # returns 7 as a string.
# This will come in handy if you wanted to print a number along with a string. Ex:
# print(str(my_num) + " is a cool number") # Returns "7 is a cool number."

# Common number related functions:
# abs():
# my_num = -6
# print(abs(my_num)) # Returns the absolute value of your number.

# pow():
#print(pow(3, 2)) # pow function takes two parameters, the first is your number, and the second is the number you want to raise it to the power of. This example returns 9.

# max()/min():
# print(max(7, 3, 9))
# print(min(7, 3, 9)) 
# Returns the largest/smallest of the numbers given as parameters.

# round(): 
# print(round(3.6)) 
# follows basic rounding rules, and rounds to the nearest number.

# Some functions require imports(floor(), ceil(), sqrt(), etc.): 
# from math import * 
# print(floor(3.8)) # Forces to round down (3) 
# print(ceil(3.2)) # Forces to round up (4)
# print(sqrt(36)) # Returns square root of number (6)
