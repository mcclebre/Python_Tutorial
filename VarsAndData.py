#variables and data types
# When creating variables, seperate different words with an underscore, rather than a dash like you would in JS. When creating a variable, you do not need to use const or let, you can just name it and set it to equal whatever value you want. 

# character_name = "Flim Flam"
# character_age = '27'
# print('There once was a man named ' + character_name + ', ')
# print('he was ' + character_age + ' years old.')

# You can update a variables value at any point, similar to a let statement.

# character_name = 'Timmy the Tim Tam'
# character_age = '42'
# print('He really liked the name ' + character_name + ', ')
# print('but didnt like being ' + character_age + '.')

# You can then use the variable and it will print whatever you set the variable to be. 
# Variables can store all sorts of data, like strings, numbers, booleans(unlike JS, booleans must be capitalized, ex: True or False), etc.
